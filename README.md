This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

API documentation: https://rapidapi.com/fyhao/api/currency-exchange

## API Key

For the app to work you'll need the API key. You can get it here: https://rapidapi.com/hub. Put it into the '.env.example' file and rename this file to '.env'. In this case the API key will be protected and used as an env variable.

Before launching you should run 'npm i' to install all necessary dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run backend`

Launches the server. Necessary to access the API key. Run before the frontend script

### `npm run frontend`

Runs the frontend part of the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
